Initial file for RMIT CNBP's Room Temperature Confocal Microscope (RTCM).
This will allow for full control and integration of the different lasers, spectrometers and microwaves etc.

This repo will be for modification both at the RTCM control computer, and on private computers - pull from repo to update at start of RTCM sessions.
